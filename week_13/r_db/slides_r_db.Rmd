## R + Databases

![](images/synergy.gif)

## Situation

1. You have a wonderful relational DB implemented with all of your beautiful data.
2. You love using `R` and R markdown to analyse your data.

**Question: ** How to analyze your relational database data in `R`?

## Options

There are many options for you. Here are 2:

1. Database backend with `dplyr`
2. Run SQL queries with `DBI`

## `dplyr`

Currently dplyr supports the three most popular open source databases (sqlite, mysql and postgresql), and google’s bigquery. If your data fits in memory there is no advantage to putting it in a database: it will only be slower and more hassle. 

The reasons you’d want to use dplyr with a database are

1. either your data is already in a database (and you don’t want to work with static csv files that someone else has dumped out for you), or
2. you have so much data that it does not fit in memory and you have to use a database. 

## Motivation

- Usually iterate between `R` and SQL many times before you get the perfect dataset.
- Switching between languages is cognitively challenging. 
- `dplyr` helps by allowing you to write `R` code that is automatically translated to SQL. 
- The goal of dplyr is not to replace every SQL function with an `R` function. Instead, dplyr only generates `SELECT` statements, the SQL you write most often during analysis.

## Let's do it!

```{r connect, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)

# set up the connection
star_wars <- src_sqlite("data/star_wars.db")

# get a table by name
planet <- tbl(star_wars, "planet")

planet %>%
  filter(population > 1e10) %>%
  summarise(count = n())
```

## Arbitrary SQL with `dplyr`

You can also use arbitrary SQL.

```{r sql}
# arbitrary sql queries
planet <- tbl(star_wars, sql("SELECT * FROM planet"))

head(planet)
```

## Laziness

`dplyr` never pulls data into `R` unless you explicitly ask for it.

It delays doing any work until the last possible moment: it collects together everything you want to do and then sends it to the database in one step.

```{r lazy}
c1 <- filter(planet, population > 1e7 & diameter < 10000)
c2 <- select(c1, name, climate, terrain, gravity, diameter, population)
c3 <- mutate(c2, surface_area = 4*pi*(diameter/2)^2)
c4 <- mutate(c3, pop_area = population/surface_area)
c5 <- arrange(c4, pop_area)
```

This sequence of operations never actually touches the database. It’s not until you ask for the data (e.g. by printing `c5`) that `dplyr` generates the SQL and requests the results from the database. Even then it only pulls down 10 rows.

## Collect

To pull down all the results use `collect()`.

```{r collect}
# dplyr doesn't actually pull all the data
dim(c5)

# unless we tell it to
c5 %>% collect() %>% dim()
```

## `DBI`
